# Overview

The problem this paper seeks to address is how to create a streamlined and self-sustaining system for decentralized governance. The solution, Choice Coin v2, will build on Choice Coinâ€™s Decentralized Decisions software to provide an integrated and continuously live web application for DAO governance. The web application will allow users to make a proposal or participate in DAO voting globally and at any time.
